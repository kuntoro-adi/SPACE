## Updates

[December 23 2023 / Jumada II 10, 1445 AH]
Renaming and restructuring some code to improve readibility.

[September 13 2023 / Safar 28, 1445 AH]    
The repository is created. We plan to migrate the code from the original repository gradually: the original repository structure is complex and we plan to publish it in a more readable format. The inference sample can be found in Note.ipynb.

[September 17 2023 / Rabi ª I 2, 1445 AH]    
Re-adjusting function name. The training code is just recently migrated. Please use kornia version 0.6.6, error may occur using another version.
